# Pixbet Content Scraper
## A WordPress plugin to scrape content from Pixbet website.
 
Great idea! Let me modify the plugin to scrape from `pixbet-apk.app` instead. This domain is likely more accessible for scraping:Perfect! I've updated the plugin to scrape from `pixbet-apk.app` instead of the main Pixbet domain. Here are the key changes:

## Updated Plugin Features:

### New Target Domain:
- **Main URL**: `https://pixbet-apk.app/`
- This domain should be more accessible and less protected than the main Pixbet site

### Updated Shortcodes:
1. `[pixbet_home]` - Main page content
2. `[pixbet_download]` - Download page (APK downloads)
3. `[pixbet_casino]` - Casino section
4. `[pixbet_sports]` - Sports betting section  
5. `[pixbet_bonus]` - Bonus/promotions page

### Cached Versions (Recommended):
- `[pixbet_home_cached]`
- `[pixbet_download_cached]`
- `[pixbet_casino_cached]`
- `[pixbet_sports_cached]`
- `[pixbet_bonus_cached]`

## Why This Should Work Better:

1. **Less Bot Protection**: APK-focused sites typically have less aggressive anti-bot measures
2. **Simpler Structure**: Usually more straightforward HTML without heavy JavaScript
3. **Mobile-Focused**: APK sites are often optimized for simple access
4. **Content-Rich**: Likely contains the Pixbet content you want to scrape

## Benefits:
- All external links still redirect to your affiliate URL: `https://seo813.pages.dev?agentid=Bet606`
- 5-minute caching for better performance
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Mobile-responsive styling
- Admin interface for cache management

Try activating this updated version. The `pixbet-apk.app` domain should be much more accessible for scraping than the main Pixbet site!
